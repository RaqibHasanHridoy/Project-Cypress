# Project-Cypress

This project appears to be an end-to-end (E2E) testing suite for a web application using Cypress. The focus of the tests is on the functionality related to the supplier within the application. The project includes various test cases to ensure that the supplier onboarding process works as expected.

- Cypress Framework:
Cypress is used for writing and running the end-to-end tests. It provides a robust and easy-to-use API for interacting with web elements and making assertions.

- Page Object Model (POM):
The project follows the Page Object Model design pattern, which helps in organizing the test code by separating the page-specific actions and locators from the test scripts. This improves code maintainability and reusability.

- Locators:
Locators are stored in JSON files, which makes it easy to manage and update them without changing the test scripts.

- Custom Commands:
Custom Cypress commands are defined to encapsulate common actions and assertions, making the test scripts cleaner and more readable.
